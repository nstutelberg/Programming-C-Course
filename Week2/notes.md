# Value literals or Constants
- By default, compilier interprets 123 as an integer. If you want to tell the compiler to treat it as a long, you need to specify that with `123L`
- Also by default, floating point numbers are interpreted as double. If you type in `3.14`, the compiler will interpret that as a double. If you want it to treat as a float, do `3.14F` or `3.14f`.
